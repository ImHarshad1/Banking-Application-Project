## 📐 Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture** ensuring separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: REST Controllers handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic, validations, and orchestration.
- **Repository Layer**: Data persistence using Spring Data JPA.
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
