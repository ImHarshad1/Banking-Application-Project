## 📐 Architecture

The project follows a **multi-layered architecture** ensuring separation of concerns:

- **Controller Layer** (`controller/`)  
  Handles incoming HTTP requests, maps endpoints, and returns responses.  

- **DTO Layer** (`dto/`)  
  Defines Data Transfer Objects for clean request/response handling.  

- **Entity Layer** (`entity/`)  
  Contains JPA entities representing database tables.  

- **Service Layer** (`service/`)  
  Implements business logic, validations, and orchestrates between controllers and repositories.  

- **Repository Layer** (`repository/`)  
  Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA.  

- **Configuration Layer** (`config/`)  
  Manages application-wide configurations such as security, CORS, and beans.  
- **Utils Layer** (`utils/`) – Provides helper functions like email notifications and common utilities.
